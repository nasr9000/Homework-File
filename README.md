# Excel-Challenge
In this challenge, small startup businesses and crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. 
We analyzed various different metrics across these businesses such as the percent funded, country of operations, currency, and the business category and subcategory.
Using Excel pivot tables, excel formulas, and excel formatting our job was to measure these columns of data and to uncover any hidden trends that may or may not have
led to their success/failures.
